# Lung Cancer Detection from 3D CTscans

<!-- The project is based on [Deep Learning with PyTorch book](https://pytorch.org/assets/deep-learning/Deep-Learning-with-PyTorch.pdf) -->


## Data

### [LUNA2016](https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/Description/)

We use LUNA Grand Challenge data to train our model. The LUNA data contains CT scans, as well as human-annotated outputs for classification and grouping. Having high-quality data has a major impact on a projectâ€™s success.
